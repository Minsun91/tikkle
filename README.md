## Tikkle project using React

This project is a website created using React to share photos uploaded to the Clicknsnap platform with friends.   
When the button is clicked, a random photo from my account is displayed.   

To add some funüòù, cute button effects were implemented, and each time the button is clicked (or when a popup appears automatically), Euro coins fall down.
